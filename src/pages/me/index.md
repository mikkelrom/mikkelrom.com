{% first-letter "My name is Mikkel Rom, I'm currently working as a Solution Architect at Knowit Denmark in Aarhus." %}

This is my blog where I'll occasionally write about things related to web technology 👨‍💻

I have a passion for web development, code and collaborating with people from other disciplines.
This blog will serve as my personal notes from my adventures in the wild world of web-tech. 🐯

**Podcasting:**\
I used to co-host a podcast about web development and frontend, find it here: [Codesplitters Podcast](https://codesplitterspodcast.com/) 🎧

**Personal:**\
I'm living in beautiful [Djursland](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Syddjurs/@56.1955727,10.1815078,9z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x464dccd219bbdf69:0x3131bb713865bb9d!8m2!3d56.3163678!4d10.5265058) outside of Aarhus with my wife, two girls and our dog Trøffel (Truffle).

**My background:**
After I finalized my [education](https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-_og_kommunikationsuddannelsen#Datatekniker) (2008), I started in backend development (C#, ASP.NET, etc.) and moved 
into a more fullstack position where I started handling the CSS and was tasked with creating
 playful experiences for kids using JavaScript. After some time I realized that I enjoyed the frontend work much 
 more than the backend development. So I decided to transition into a fulltime frontend position (2017).

After many years of working with frontend development as a senior frontend developer and later on as a lead frontend developer, 
I got the opportunity (2023) to challenge myself by taking on a role as Solution Architect. Luckily, it's been a great experience so far and I'm glad that I'm still learning new skills.
