{% first-letter "My name is Mikkel Rom, I'm currently Lead Frontend Developer at Creuna in Aarhus, Denmark." %}

This is my blog where I'll occasionally write about things related to web development 👨‍💻

I'm also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mikkelrom) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikkelrom/).

I'm living in beautiful [Djursland](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Syddjurs/@56.1955727,10.1815078,9z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x464dccd219bbdf69:0x3131bb713865bb9d!8m2!3d56.3163678!4d10.5265058) outside of Aarhus in Denmark 🇩🇰 with my wife and two girls.	

I have a passion for web development and collaborating with people from other disciplines.	
This blog will serve as my personal notes from my adventures in the wild world of web-tech.	

My background:
After I finalized my [education](https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-_og_kommunikationsuddannelsen#Datatekniker), I started in backend development (C#, ASP.NET, etc.) and moved 	
into a more fullstack position where I started handling the CSS and was tasked with creating	
 playful experiences for kids using JavaScript. After some time I realized that I enjoyed the frontend work much 	
 more than the backend development and server configuration. So I decided to transition into a fulltime frontend position - and I haven't looked back, best decision ever ❤️️
