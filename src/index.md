My name is Mikkel Rom, I'm currently Lead Frontend Developer at [Creuna](https://www.creuna.com/dk/) in Aarhus, Denmark.
I'm living in beautiful Djursland outside of Aarhus with my wife and two girls.

I have a passion for web development and collaborating with people from other disciplines.
This blog will serve as my personal notes from my adventures in the wild world of web-tech.

My background:
After I finalized my education, I started in backend development (C#, ASP.NET, etc.) and moved 
into a more fullstack position where I started handling the CSS and was tasked with creating
 playful experiences for kids using JavaScript. After some time I realized that I enjoyed the frontend work much 
 more than the backend development and server configuration. So I decided to transition into a fulltime frontend position - and I haven't looked back, best decision ever ‚ù§Ô∏èÔ∏è
